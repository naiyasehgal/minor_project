				<div class="body"><font face="arial">
					<p> Children are very vulnerable when it comes to Domestic servitude. Often children are told that they will be offered excellent wages to work as a maid in middle-class homes, but they usually end up being severely underpaid and abused. Every year hundreds of thousands of girls are trafficked from rural India to work as maids. A root cause of commercial exploitation and child trafficking in India is due to lack of education, and the need to support their family.</p>

				<div class="body"><font face="arial">
					<p> 27% of girls in India are married before their 18th birthday. Child marriage is more common among poorer households, with many families marrying off their daughters to reduce their perceived economic burden. Girls are often married off at a younger age or during schooling because less dowry is expected for younger brides. Girls' education benefit her marital family, and educating daughters is therefore seen as less of a priority than educating sons.
